# Rush-Hour
This is my second Unity-based game.
It is a 2D game where you can pick a character, each character is supposed to have a different weapon,
and you start the first level with your unupgraded weapon where you have to defeat different enemies,
and collect loot from chests to upgrade yourself and your weapon.
The levels are maze-like, which means you have to navigate to reach the end, and you finish the game by defeating the last boss.
